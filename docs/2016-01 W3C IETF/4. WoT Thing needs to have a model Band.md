# 4. WoT Thing needs to have a model Band

Points:

* magic words
* temperature v temperature
* incomplete models
* massive variation

## Magic Words

The Internet today is made up of "magic words". In the HTTP Header, "Content-Type", "If-Modified-Since", … and so forth. In TCP, "Sequence Number", "Acknowledgement Number", …. 

The (admittedly straw man) proposal here (https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hartke-core-lighting-00) standardizes the magic words: on, brightness, hue, saturation, x, y, colorTemperature, colorMode. 

{
       "on": true,
       "brightness": 0.5,
       "hue": 210,
       "saturation": 0.9,
       "x": 0.4448,
       "y": 0.4066,
       "colorTemperature": 343,
       "colorMode": "ct"
     }

A Sensor proposal (https://w3c.github.io/sensors/) has this:

    enum ProximitySensorPosition {
        "top-left",
        "top",
        "top-right",
        "middle-left",
        "middle",
        "middle-right",
        "bottom-left",
        "bottom",
        "bottom-right"
    };

This approach will not work well with the Internet of Things, for the reasons outlined below.

## Magic Words are not HATEOAS

## Which Magic Word: temperature v temperature

## Incomplete Models

## Variation of Sensors / Things

## If we're doing Semantics, use Linked Data

## The Model Band
