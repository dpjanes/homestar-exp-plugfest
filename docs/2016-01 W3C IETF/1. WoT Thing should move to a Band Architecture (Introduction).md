# 1. WoT Thing should move to a Band Architecture (Introduction)

This will be a series of postings, discussing issues the WoT Thing model and proposed solutions

1. WoT Thing should move to a Band Architecture (Introduction)
1. WoT Thing needs to have istate/ostate Bands
1. WoT Thing needs to have meta Band
1. WoT Thing needs to have a model Band
1. Actions should be used lightly; and should return a new Thing
1. WoT Thing should move to a Band Architecture (Conclusion)

## Code

We'll be writing code examples in NodeJS and JSON. Don't get caught up in the details.

Also note that I'm writing all this in a hurry, feel free get back to me.

## Reference Model

The reference model is from (https://github.com/w3c/wot/blob/master/TF-AP/thing-api/thing-api-webidl.md).

    interface Thing: EventTarget {
        readonly attribute DOMString id;
        readonly attribute DOMString type;
        readonly attribute DOMString name;
        readonly attribute boolean reachable;
        attribute EventHandler onreachabilitychange;
        Promise<any> callAction(DOMString actionName, any parameter);
        Promise<any> setProperty(DOMString propertyName, any newValue)a;
        Promise<any> getProperty(DOMString propertyName);
        void addListener(DOMString eventName, ThingEventListener listener);
        void removeListener(DOMString eventName, ThingEventListener listener);
        void removeAllListeners(DOMString eventName);
    }
